## Overview

Local search algorithms start from an initial solution and explore neighboring solutions to find improvements. They are widely used in combinatorial optimization problems where exhaustive search is impractical.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Tabu Search
- Genetic Algorithms (basic framework)

## Applications

- Scheduling problems
- Vehicle routing
- Resource allocation
- Machine learning hyperparameter tuning
- Constraint satisfaction problems

## Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm          | Time Complexity (Typical) | Space Complexity | Notes                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Hill Climbing      | O(iterations * neighbors) | O(1)             | Simple but can get stuck in local optima |
| Simulated Annealing| O(iterations)             | O(1)             | Can escape local optima with probability |
| Tabu Search        | O(iterations)             | O(tabu list size)| Uses memory to avoid cycles    |
| Genetic Algorithms | O(generations * population size) | O(population size) | Population-based search       |

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a C++ class with methods to configure parameters, run the search, and retrieve the best solution found.

Example usage:

```cpp
#include "HillClimbing.h"

int main() {
    HillClimbing hc;
    hc.setInitialSolution(...);
    hc.setMaxIterations(1000);
    hc.run();
    auto best = hc.getBestSolution();
    // Process best solution
    return 0;
}
```
