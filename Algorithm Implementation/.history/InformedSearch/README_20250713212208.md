## 🧠 How Algorithms Work

### 🎯 Best First Search (Greedy)
Uses only heuristic function h(n) to guide search. Always expands the node that appears closest to goal according to heuristic. Fast but not guaranteed to find optimal path.

### ⭐ A* Search
Combines actual cost g(n) and heuristic h(n) using evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n). Guarantees optimal solution when heuristic is admissible and consistent.

### 🔀 AO* Search (AND-OR)
Designed for AND-OR graphs where nodes can have AND or OR relationships. Handles complex problem decomposition where multiple subgoals must be achieved simultaneously (AND) or alternatively (OR).

## 🎯 Applications

### 🎯 Best First Search Applications
- Route Planning - quick approximate paths
- Game AI - fast move evaluation
- Web Search - content relevance ranking
- Resource Allocation - greedy optimization
- Real-time Systems - time-critical decisions

### ⭐ A* Search Applications
- GPS Navigation - optimal route finding
- Video Game Pathfinding - NPC movement
- Robotics - obstacle avoidance and planning
- Network Routing - optimal packet paths
- Puzzle Solving - 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle optimization

### 🔀 AO* Search Applications
- Automated Planning - goal decomposition
- Expert Systems - rule-based reasoning
- Natural Language Processing - parsing trees
- Software Engineering - modular design
- Project Management - task dependency resolution
