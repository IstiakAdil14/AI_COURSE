🧠 How Algorithms Work

🎯 MinMax Algorithm

A recursive decision-making algorithm for two-player games. The maximizing player seeks the highest score while the minimizing player seeks the lowest score. It explores the entire game tree to find optimal moves assuming both players play perfectly.

✂️ Alpha-Beta Pruning

An optimization of MinMax that eliminates branches that cannot influence the final decision. Uses alpha (best maximizer score) and beta (best minimizer score) bounds to prune unnecessary subtrees, significantly reducing computation time.

🎮 Game Integration

Complete Tic-Tac-Toe implementation demonstrating practical application where AI (X) plays optimally against human player (O) using Alpha-Beta pruning for move selection.

🎯 Applications

⚡ Complexity Analysis

Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Pruning Efficiency	Optimal?	Complete?
MinMax 🎯	O(b^d)	O(d)	None	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Alpha-Beta ✂️	O(b^(d/2))*	O(d)	Up to 50%	✅ Yes	✅ Yes

Legend:

b = Branching factor (possible moves per position)
d = Maximum depth of game tree
* = Best case with optimal move ordering

Performance Characteristics:

MinMax: Exhaustive but complete optimal solution
Alpha-Beta: Same optimality with significantly faster execution

Tic-Tac-Toe Specifics:

Maximum depth: 9 moves
Branching factor: 9 to 1 (decreasing)
Total positions: ~362,880 (9!)
Alpha-Beta reduces to ~10,000 evaluations

🛠️ Usage

Basic Game Setup

// Create game instance
MinMaxAlphaBeta game;

// Initialize empty 3x3 board
vector<vector<char>> board(3, vector<char>(3, ' '));

// Set players
// 'X' = AI (maximizing player)
// 'O' = Human (minimizing player)

Algorithm Usage

// Use MinMax algorithm
int score = game.min_max(board, 0, true);

// Use Alpha-Beta pruning (recommended)
int score = game.alpha_beta(board, 0, true, numeric_limits<int>::min(), numeric_limits<int>::max());

// Get best move for AI
pair<int, int> best_move = game.get_best_move(board, true);

// Make a move
vector<vector<char>> new_board = game.make_move(board, best_move, 'X');

Interactive Game Play

Run the compiled executable and follow the prompts:
- Human enters move (row, col)
- AI calculates optimal response
- Board updates and displays
- Repeat until win/draw
