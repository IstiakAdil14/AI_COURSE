MinMax & Alpha-Beta Pruning Implementation ðŸŽ®

This project contains a C++ implementation of the MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms applied to the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Features

- **MinMax Algorithm**: A recursive algorithm to choose the optimal move for the AI player by exploring all possible game states.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization of the MinMax algorithm that prunes branches in the game tree that cannot affect the final decision, improving efficiency.
- **Playable Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: Includes a command-line interface where a human player can play against the AI.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid moves and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## File Structure

- `TicTacToe.cpp`: Main C++ source file containing the implementation of the MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms and the game loop.

## How to Compile and Run

Use a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.

```bash
g++ -o TicTacToe TicTacToe.cpp
./TicTacToe
```

## How to Play

- The human player uses 'O' and the AI uses 'X'.
- Enter your move by specifying the row and column numbers (0-2).
- The game will display the board after each move.
- The game ends when there is a winner or a draw.

## Notes

- The AI uses Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient decision making.
- The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid.
