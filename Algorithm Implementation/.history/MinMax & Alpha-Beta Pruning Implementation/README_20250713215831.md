# MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning Implementation

This project contains a C++ implementation of the MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms applied to the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Features

- **MinMax Algorithm**: A recursive algorithm to choose the optimal move for the AI player by exploring all possible game states.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization of the MinMax algorithm that prunes branches in the game tree that cannot affect the final decision, improving efficiency.
- **Playable Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: Includes a command-line interface where a human player can play against the AI.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid moves and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## File Structure

- `TicTacToe.cpp`: Main C++ source file containing the implementation of the MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms and the game loop.

## How to Compile and Run

Use a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.

```bash
